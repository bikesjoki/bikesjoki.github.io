Honda CR 125 1980 ELSINORE TWINSHOCK EVO CLASSIC MX BIKE AT CRAIGS From me-moto.com
Honda normalized some of the outlandish features of the previous year, and the bike took its place side by side with the suzuki and yamaha for dominance in the 125 class. Husqvarna was a dominant force in the motocross world, winning 14 motocross world championships in the 125 cc, 250 cc and 500 cc divisions, 24 enduro world championships and 11 baja 1000 victories. The honda cg 125 was launched way back in 1975 and served as the ultimate commuter bike for over 30 years.
