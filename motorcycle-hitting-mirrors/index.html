My favorite mirror setup yet CRG Arrows mounted on Rhinomoto barends From reddit.com
For me they always hit the tank when they are in a good position to see. Smash car window and hit off mirrors. What�s a mirror, like about 15 bucks? Go out to your bike, sit on it with both legs firmly on the ground.
