How to Ride a Motorcycle on the Highway YouTube From youtube.com
I had only been on the freeway twice before for a few miles when i rode my friend�s girlfriends 250 and the one time i rode my dirt biased dual sport on the dallas north tollway. I spent my first day riding the bike doing it in a area with relatively few cars and racked up about 250km (155 miles). Wait to ride on major highways. If you want to practice it, as r/willillica stated start on a saturday morning.
