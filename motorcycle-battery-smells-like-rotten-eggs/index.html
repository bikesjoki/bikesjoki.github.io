Rotten egg smell in city fresh water Montana Owners Club Keystone From montanaowners.com
Egg/sulfur smell is usually the cat not functioning properly. Typically, it will just cause throat irritation but in large enough concentrations hydrogen sulfide can be lethal. If you charge to max (volt meter should read 13v) then you only get one or two starts from the battery then it is fcuked. Given that this is china, there was luckily a place just around the corner.
