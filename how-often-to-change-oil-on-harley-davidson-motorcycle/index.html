Replace fuel filter every 100000 mi (161,000 km). How often should i have my harley’s motorcycle oil changed? I was going to change it at 3000 but wasnt sure how i was supposed to do it. Even dino oil would be 5000 miles between changes after the first change at 1000 miles.some people change every year or every 5000 miles whichever comes first.
