How To Spray Paint a Motorcycle Rim COLOR SPARKLING GOLD SAMURAI From youtube.com
Remove the rims from your motorcycle and set aside. Temperature should be between 60 and 80 degrees with minimal humidity. In the event that we have the tire on, what we must do is seal it with newspaper and masking tape, so that only the rim is visible and the tire cover is completely covered. A special blend of polymer resin is then placed in a sprayer that charges the particles which is then sprayed on the rims.
