R1 fuel cut out suddenly at high rpms? Motorcycle 7 USA From motorcycle7usa.com
If the engine was down on power, intake clogged, or fuel problem, it would have bogged way before getting to 6k rpm in 5th gear. Of course, the end result is a dramatic loss of power. When your pulling high revs fuel flow would be at its highest and any restriction (rust,dirt,crud) may be hampering that. Any idle higher than 1,500 rpm’s is considered high and should be adjusted.

What i think happens is that the clutch can�t transmit enough power to overcome the drag when going fast (in my case it was 60mph) so the clutch starts slipping, then heats up and the plates expand, then the expanded plates provide more friction and the clutch stops slipping, then the plates cool down and shrink, repeat ad nauseam. Some of these common causes are: Of course, the end result is a dramatic loss of power. Some motorcycles are a little different from each other, so be sure to check your owner’s manual to make sure.
