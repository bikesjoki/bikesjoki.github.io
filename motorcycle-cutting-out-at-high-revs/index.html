However, revving an engine for a long period of time can eventually cause damage. The very first thing i would check would be continuity in the wires from the ecu to the servo motor.

<p>The concern was a faulty voltage regulatory authority, which was preventing power from the stator getting to the electrical system. There are several reasons why a motorcycle sputters. And by the way this works at any throttle position all you have to do is pay attention to what the motor does when you. Recently, my bike has been cutting out or bogging down at full throttle, anything below half throttle is fine, but this is strange as it was fine a few days ago, was happy at fully throttle, but now when i open it up from a slow speed, the rev�s will die out and stall, if i do it at high speed, it sounds like im chopping on and off the throttle then it will bog down. This bog often feels like a ‘burble.’ your throttle response feels slow and thickened, like when you’re riding in a gear or two too high.</p>
