9 Dead After BikerGang Gun Battle in Texas From nymag.com
If one car travels at 60 mph and the other at 45 mph, how long will it take them to be 80 miles apart? Now, cyclist doubles its speed, so it reaches b at 10:30, so maximum motorcycles that can start are from 10:01 to 10:15, so 15 is the correct answer. Of course there are basic differents between a motorcycle and a car : The time in question was 1.2 hours, or 72 minutes, after noon, which is 1:12 pm.
