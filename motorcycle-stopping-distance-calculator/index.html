<meta name="description" content="Motorcycle Stopping Distance Calculator, From 40 mph a typical rider will need somewhere between 100 and 125 feet to get the bike stopped, depending on ability. If we do assume that the brakes will produce a similar stopping distance to those of a car then at 70 km/hr the total stopping distance (thinking distance plus braking distance) would be about 44 m (thinking 13m plus braking 31m).
Why Stopping Distances Matter More During the Winter TranBC From tranbc.ca
Most of all, braking distance varies with speed. Stopping distance calculator i would be happy to discuss the model if you care. The calculator below estimates the stopping distance for a well maintained car with an alert driver on a dry road. Experiment with your stopping distance using the calculator below.
