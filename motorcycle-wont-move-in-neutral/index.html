<p>Noticing i cannot sift to neutral while the bike is running. Neutral, starter lockout, or side stand switch trouble. Video shows clutch in firs. It doesn�t seem to be a problem when the bike isn�t running, i can shut it down and then easily upshift into neutral by moving the lever with my hand (so there�s no specific mechanical blockage of the shift lever or rod) but the bike doesn�t want to upshift from 1st to second or 1st to neutral without significant effort while on / stopped and hot. So when shifting from 1st i could get neutral (between 1st and 2nd), 2nd gear (very unlikely ), neutral (between 2nd and 3rd, most likely ), 3rd gear or neutral (the one between 3rd and 4th).</p>
