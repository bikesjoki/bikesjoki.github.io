Shelton Trails Committee July 2012 From sheltontrailscom.blogspot.com
Once you are at a comfortable speed, slowly release the clutch, and use your gearing to slow you down the rest of the way. On a motorcycle trip of northern new mexico a few years ago, genevieve and i encountered a gravel roadway unexpectedly. Ride slowly while applying light pressure to your brakes. Practice friction zone &amp; throttle control until you feel comfortable enough where you can walk the bike up the driveway.
