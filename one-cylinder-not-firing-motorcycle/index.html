<p>So run the bike and determine which cylinders are not firing for sure. I am also one of he many people trying to solve a single firing cylinder at idle and am running out of ideas too. But both plugs are sparking. Not getting fuel do to clogged jet in the carbs for those cylinders. A bike firing on only one cylinder or afterfiring from one cylinder can mean a few things.</p>

<p>The engine will produce some compression related exhaust pressure even on a dead cylinder that is similar to a live one. If it does, then replace all 4 sparkplug wires. Use a squirtgun and hit the header with some water. Maybe one of the carbs has a stuck float, open the drains on both and see if they have fuel.

<p>Try changing #1 and #4 sparkplug wires and see if the cold cylinder follows it. If anyone is still looking for a possible solution to 1 or 2 cylinders not firing one possible solution is a vaccum leak. I am also one of he many people trying to solve a single firing cylinder at idle and am running out of. firing only on 1 cylinder 1973 honda cb 450 Page 3.</p>

<p>Then try cleaning your carb again These engines have what is known as a “wasted spark” that is, a sparkplug will fire during an exhaust stroke. Almost always, raw fuel on exhaust indicates a flooded engine. Use a squirtgun and hit the header with some water. I have a single fire coil so i swapped the wires to see if.

Then try cleaning your carb again These engines have what is known as a “wasted spark” that is, a sparkplug will fire during an exhaust stroke. Went to go fire it up and only the rear cylinder is firing. This could be from excessive carbon build up from being way overdue for a plug change, running too rich, to being oil fouled the oil fouling would be due to either bad rings allowing too much oil into the combustion chamber, or bad valve guide. There is a sensor mounted on the top of the drive.</p>
