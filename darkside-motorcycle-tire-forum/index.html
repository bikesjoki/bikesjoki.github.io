Darkside death wobble Page 7 Victory Motorcycles Motorcycle Forums From thevog.net
It looks like many people like 195/55r16 (bridgestone driveguard run flat seems very popular one with good result) i then came across some darkside the other day and he (and his friends) all told me i’d like 175/60. My understanding is that darkside is simply running a car tire on the back wheel of a motorcycle. In the event that a car tire has an intended direction of rotation, this direction would be maintained on the back wheel of the motorcycle. I picked up a 2018 goldwing 1800 b, in november with 400 miles on the stock tires.
