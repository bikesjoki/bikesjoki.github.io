<p>This is where it gets tricky. Initially, the car and the motorcycle are both traveling at the same speed of 21.5 m/s , and the distance between them is 51.0 mm. Use p, n, and z for positive (upward), negative, and zero, respectively. If uphill is chosen as the positive direction, what is the car’s average acceleration? 06 × 10. http apod nasa gov apod image 0804 lmcdeepwide beletsky big jpg.</p>
