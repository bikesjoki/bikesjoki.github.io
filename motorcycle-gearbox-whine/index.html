Breather Gear Causing Whine? Harley Davidson Forums From hdforums.com
Although it is not as loud, i can still hear the whine when i go into 4th gear. Prior to the first service (600 miles) recently,never noted any unusual noise from ther transmission.they changed the oil to semi synthetic and adjusted the chain along with the normal checks. Gear whine was so bad. I hear it in 3rd and 4th but not as loud.
