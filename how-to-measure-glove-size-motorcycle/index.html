If you currently wear a size 36 jean, please order an rst size 36. Place your dominant hand lightly on a table and using a flexible measuring tape, measure the circumference of your palm at its widest point. Measure the circumference of your hand in a loop as shown, at the widest part of your palm bringing the tape measure all the way round until it joins back at the beginning. Do not include your thumb in this measurement and measure lower than all of your knuckles (be careful not to measure too far forward on your pinky finger side as this knuckle is further back).
