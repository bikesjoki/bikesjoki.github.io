For example, at time x the angle was 5 degrees. Negative camber may require a more cautious approach with the track falling away from you. The motorcycle tilts to average out the accelerations. The simulator then gives you your forward lean, knee and hip angles, as well as the seat height, which is measured from where the simulation has you seated on the bike instead of measuring from the lowest point on the seat, like most manufacturers do.
