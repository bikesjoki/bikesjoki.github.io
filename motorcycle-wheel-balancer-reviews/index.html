Goplus Wheel Balancer, Rim Tire Balancing Spin Static Truing Stand with From desertcart.ae
The wheel balancer was bought @20 % off selling price. It assembled easily, and the bubble level was easy enough to use. I think rod has since stopped manufacturing it, unfortunately, because it was very popular with “diyers” and ours has served us well through all these years. At a capacity of 1800 lbs, there’s almost no motorcycle tire that you cannot use this chock to haul.
