KEOGHS Motorcycle Rear Hydraulic Disc Brake Set Diy Modify Cnc Rpm From pinterest.com
Your rear drum brakes squeal for a number of reasons. Reinstall the brake pads and calipers using the pins or bolts. The squealing seems to occur during forward travel when the drum brakes engage gently. In a disc brake system, brake dust gets trapped between the braking pad and the brake disc (rotor) — causing uneven braking and a squealing noise.
