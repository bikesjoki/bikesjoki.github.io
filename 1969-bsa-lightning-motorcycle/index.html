Please view the 10 minute video, the 100&#43; photos, and extensive info below to get a clear understanding of the condition of this lightning. The 654cc ohv parallel twin, unit engine design with twin carburetors and 4 speed gearbox that made 53 hp at 7,000 rpm was enough to propel the lightning to a top speed of 115 mph even at 421 lbs dry weight. It just never had the styling to compete with the triumph. It has been lightly ridden and always garaged.
