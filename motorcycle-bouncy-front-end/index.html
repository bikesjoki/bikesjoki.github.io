Picture Thread Girder Front Ends Page 2 From chopcult.com
Motorcycle repair, building, and restoration. I was feeling this weird front end bounce on my yamaha roadstar so i took it to my local shop and they turned the wheel on the rim and rebalanced it. How would the rear tire exaserbate front end bounce? When i got my first strom i didn�t like the front end, to me it felt distant and not well planted on the surface.
