ROAD GRIPPER Tourino Bike Tyres From mytourino.com
I wash/shine my bike, wheels and tires thoroughly once per year. That said, either of these should get rid of any tire shine. That greenish ugly stuff you might see on a tire over time is that preservative coming to the surface. Honestely though soap and water and maintain proper tire pressures at all times runnin them low will make them run hotter than normal and after long milage they may begin to loose alittle pigment in the sidewalls.
