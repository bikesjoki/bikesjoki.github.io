OldMotoDude 1971 Maico MX400 on display at the 2013 Idaho Vintage From oldmotodude.blogspot.com
Originally a german motorcycle manufacturer founded in the early 1930s, maico at one point was the worlds largest 500cc motorcross producer until the company went out of business in the early 1980s after several product flops. Since more than 30 years we prepare special maico bikes. This maico was recently discovered in a warehouse and is looking a bit worse for the wear. In 1981 the maico 490 sold more open class bikes than, for example honda did in their entire motocross line in the us.
