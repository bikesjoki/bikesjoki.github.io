2004 R6 race bike From r6messagenet.com
Kept getting worse, including the difficulty restarting and had to run at higher and higher rpm�s to keep it running. It�s only part throttle i have the issue. Zx6r stutter/misfire/low rpm troubles discussion in �mechanical &amp; technical� started by kml, may 18, 2010. I bought this clean 99 gt and there was a minor low rpm misfire but that was the only thing wrong.

<p>I had tried on my own fz6 with remus on, it like i hitting the pc3 accelerator. Running rough at low rpm�s is usually a sign of too much fuel as well. Rough idling is a problem that should not be taken lightly. 1.9 faulty engine temperature sensor. The bike sat for about two to three weeks and ever since.

<p>I had tried on my own fz6 with remus on, it like i hitting the pc3 accelerator. The backfiring is from too much fuel getting into the exhaust and igniting. This prevents the engine from spinning to the moon and self destructing. Its got a new battery and i�ve already went. The bike sat for about two to three weeks.

<p>Then it ran rough at low (under 4k) rpm. Refitted oem exhaust with cat, still got misfire with such low mileage (sub 4k) i cant believe it would be the plugs, but idk other possibilities are 1) damaged ecu due to wrong servo buddy, (but i really doubt this one) 2) stick coils 3) lambda/02 sensor 4)fuel pump no f1. 2004 R6 race bike.</p>

<p>I had tried on my own fz6 with remus on, it like i hitting the pc3 accelerator. As tak419 mentioned.it could be as simple as a plug wire boot slipping off the spark plug side. Then above 2k rpm�s the car seems to run fine and i cannot notice the miss. All i could notice was that my idle speed. 2021 Honda CB500X, CB500F, and CBR500R Get Their Euro 5 On.</p>

<p>Wassup y�all i got a little problem. Seemed to be running fine and all of a sudden a few weeks ago, it sounded like a vtwin and loss of power near idle.

<p>It feels more load dependent and happens everywhere in the throttle during these rpms. At the limit of lean carburetion,any loss of spark shows up as a miss.
